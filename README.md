# Using Microsoft authentication library in React

## Authentication
Logging in Microsoft account in react with `@azure/msal-react` and `@azure/msal-browser` libraries is more customizable than `@microsoft/mgt`.

## Calling Microsoft Graph endpoints
We can get access token from msal instance to call MS Graph endpoint easily

If we want customize components easier, using these libs is better than using react components in `@microsoft/mgt-react`
